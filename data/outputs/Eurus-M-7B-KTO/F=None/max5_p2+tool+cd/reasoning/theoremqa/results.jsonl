The centripetal force is provided by the normal force between the tires and the road. The coefficient of static friction is the ratio of the maximum static frictional force to the normal force.\n\nTo calculate the minimum coefficient of static friction, we need to find the normal force and the maximum static frictional force.\n\nThe normal force is given by the equation:\n\nNormal force (N) = m * v^2 / r\n\nwhere m is the mass of the vehicle, v is the speed of the vehicle, and r is the radius of the curve.\n\nThe maximum static frictional force is given by the equation:\n\nMaximum static frictional force (f_s) = \u03bc_s * N\n\nwhere \u03bc_s is the coefficient of static friction.\n\nThe centripetal force is given by the equation:\n\nCentripetal force (F_c) = m * v^2 / r\n\nSince the centripetal force is provided by the normal force, we can equate the two:\n\nF_c = N\n\nNow we can substitute the values into the equations and solve for the minimum coefficient of static friction.\n\nLet's calculate the minimum coefficient of static friction using the given
