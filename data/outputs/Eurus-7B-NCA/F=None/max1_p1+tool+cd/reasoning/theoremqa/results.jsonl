A labelled forest is a graph where each connected component is a tree, and each vertex is assigned a unique label.\n\nIn this case, we have 8 vertices, and we want to find the number of labelled forests with 5 connected components, where vertices 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 belong to different connected components.\n\nWe can start by calculating the number of ways to choose the labels for the vertices in each connected component. Since vertices 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 must belong to different connected components, we have 3 remaining vertices (6, 7, 8) that can be assigned to the 5 connected components.\n\nWe can use the PIE formula to calculate the number of labelled forests:\n\nNumber of labelled forests = \u220f(k-1)! * (n-k)!, where k is the number of vertices in each connected component, and n is the total number of vertices.\n\nIn this case, we have 3 vertices in each connected component, so k = 3. We have 5 connected components, so n = 8.\n\nPlugging these values into the PIE formula, we get:\n\nNumber of labelled forests = \u220f(3-1)! * (8-3)!\nNumber of labelled forests = \u220f(2)! * (5)!\nNumber of labelled forests = 2! * 5!\nNumber of labelled forests = 2 * 120\nNumber of labelled forests = 240\n\nTherefore, the number of labelled forests on 8 vertices with 5 connected components, such that vertices 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 all belong to different connected components, is 240.
