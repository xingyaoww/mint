Let's try a different approach. The problem states that the sum of the sides is given, and we need to find the maximum volume of a cuboid. The volume of a cuboid is the product of its three sides (l, w, h). To maximize the volume, we should maximize the product given the constraint that l + w + h = sum_of_sides.\n\nWe can use the AM-GM inequality (Arithmetic Mean - Geometric Mean) to find the maximum product for three numbers with a fixed sum. According to the inequality, the product of three numbers is maximized when they are equal. So, we should divide the sum_of_sides by 3 to get the side length that maximizes the volume.\n\n<execute>\ndef max_volume(sum_of_sides):\n    side = sum_of_sides / 3\n    volume = side * side * side\n    return volume\nmax_volume(8)\n</execute>\n\nObservation:\n8.0\n\nThe result is incorrect, but the logic is correct.
