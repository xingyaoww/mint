Let's reevaluate the problem using a different approach. The sequence $F_n(x)$ is a sequence of antiderivatives of the logarithm function. Since the logarithm is a strictly increasing function, its antiderivatives will also be strictly increasing. Moreover, as $n$ increases, the area under the curve of the logarithm from 0 to 1 will be more and more accurately approximated by the trapezoidal rule with more and more divisions. The limit of this sequence of areas as $n$ goes to infinity should approach the total area under the curve, which is the integral of the logarithm from 0 to 1.\n\nThe integral of the logarithm from 0 to 1 is $-\\infty$ because the logarithm function goes to negative infinity as $x$ approaches 0. Therefore, the limit of the sequence $\\frac{n! F_n(1)}{\\log(n)}$ as $n$ goes to infinity is also $-\\infty$.\n\nHowever, the output format requires a float, so we cannot directly provide $-\\infty$.

In a labeled forest, each vertex is uniquely identified by a label.
