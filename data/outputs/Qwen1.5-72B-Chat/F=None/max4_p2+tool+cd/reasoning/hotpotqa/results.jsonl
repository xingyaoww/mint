Filmed in the then recently introduced CinemaScope format and directed by Nicholas Ray, it offered both social commentary and an alternative to previous films depicting delinquents in urban slum environments. The film stars James Dean, Natalie Wood, Sal Mineo, Jim Backus, Ann Doran, Corey Allen and William Hopper. Dennis Hopper made his film debut in a small role.\nThe film was an attempt to portray the moral decay of American youth, critique parental style, and explore the differences and conflicts between generations.

His last lead role was a Texan rancher who discovered oil and became rich, in Giant (1956).\nDean died in a car crash in 1955. He became the only actor to receive two posthumous Academy Award acting nominations, being nominated in the Best Actor category for East of Eden and Giant.

In the spring of 1837, the violence was brought under control after the government deployed troops to arrest the Shiners.
