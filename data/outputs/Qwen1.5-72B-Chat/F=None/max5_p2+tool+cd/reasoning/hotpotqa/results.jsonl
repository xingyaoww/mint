It contains the Hunter River and its tributaries with highland areas to the north and south. Situated at the northern end of the Sydney Basin bioregion, the Hunter Valley is one of the largest river valleys on the NSW coast, and is most commonly known for its wineries and coal industry.\nMost of the population of the Hunter Region lives within 25 km (16 mi) of the coast, with 55% of the entire population living in the cities of Newcastle and Lake Macquarie. There are numerous other towns and villages scattered across the region in the eleven local government areas (LGAs) that make up the region. At the 2021 census the combined population of the region was 682,465, and is expected to reach over 1,000,000 people by 2031.

His parents married in 1855. The young Doyle was sent to the Jesuit preparatory school Hodder Place, Stonyhurst, at the age of nine. He then went on to Stonyhurst College, a Jesuit school, until 1875. From 1875 to 1876, he was educated at the Jesuit school Stella Matutina in Feldkirch, Austria.\\nIn 1876, Doyle began studying medicine at the University of Edinburgh Medical School. He did not neglect his literary interests, however, and while a student, he wrote short stories. His first published piece, 'The Mystery of the Sasquatch', appeared in the Edinburgh University Magazine in 1879. In 1885, he gained his Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery degrees. After a brief time in Edinburgh, he moved to London, where he lived and worked for most of his life.\\nIn 1882, he joined a practice in Southsea, and became a partner a year later. During this period, he wrote A Study in Scarlet, his first story featuring Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John H. Watson. The story was initially rejected by several publishers, but finally accepted by Beeton's Christmas Annual for 1887.

Gollum was a Stoor Hobbit of the River-folk who lived near the Gladden Fields. In The Lord of the Rings it is stated that he was originally known as Sm\u00e9agol, corrupted by the One Ring, and later named Gollum after his habit of making \"a horrible swallowing noise in his throat\".Sm\u00e9agol obtained the Ring by murdering his relative D\u00e9agol, who found it in the River Anduin. Gollum referred to the Ring as \"my precious\" or \"precious\", and it extended his life far beyond natural limits. Centuries of the Ring's influence twisted Gollum's body and mind, and, by the time of the novels, he \"loved and hated [the Ring], as he loved and hated himself.\" Throughout the story, Gollum was torn between his lust for the Ring and his desire to be free of it.
