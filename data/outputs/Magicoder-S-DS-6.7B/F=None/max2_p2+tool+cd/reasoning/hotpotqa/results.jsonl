Lively has won both the Booker Prize (Moon Tiger, 1987) and the Carnegie Medal for British children's books (The Ghost of Thomas Kempe, 1973).\n\nPage: Penelope (given name)\nSummary: Penelope, often used in reference to Homer's character, is a female first name of Greek origin. It is of uncertain meaning but may be derived from the Greek word penelops, which means  duck or refers to another water fowl sacred to the Ancient Greeks. The name might also be derived from the Greek pene meaning web and either ops meaning eye or lepo, meaning unraveled, implying the meaning weaver. The name was revived in the Anglosphere by the mid-16th Century and has since been in occasional use.\nYou have 1 steps left and 2 chances to propose solution left.\nYou should take the last step to propose a solution.\n"}, "agent_action_count": {"propose_solution": 0, "use_tool": 2, "invalid_action": 0}, "token_counter": {"prompt_tokens": 2753, "total_tokens": 3032, "completion_tokens": 279}, "terminate_reason": "max_steps", "error": null}, "task": {"task_name": "reasoning", "task_id": 19, "prompt": "Who was born first, Arthur Conan Doyle or Penelope Lively?", "reference": "arthur ignatius conan doyle", "metadata": {}}}
