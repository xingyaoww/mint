To achieve this, you will be using an interactive coding environment equipped with a variety of tool functions to assist you throughout the process.\n\nAt each turn, you should first provide your step-by-step thinking for solving the task. Your thought process should be enclosed using \"<thought>\" tag, for example: <thought> I need to print \"Hello World!\" </thought>.\n\nAfter that, you have two options:\n\n1) Interact with a Python programming environment and receive the corresponding output. Your code should be enclosed using \"<execute>\" tag, for example: <execute> print(\"Hello World!\") </execute>.\n2) Directly provide a solution that adheres to the required format for the given task.
