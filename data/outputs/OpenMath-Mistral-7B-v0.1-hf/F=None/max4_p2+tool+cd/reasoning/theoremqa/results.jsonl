photoelectric effect formula:\n$E_k = h\\nu - \\phi$, where $E_k$ is the kinetic energy of the photoelectron, $h$ is the Planck's constant, $\\nu$ is the frequency of the light, and $\\phi$ is the work function of the metal.\n\nIn this case, we have $E_k = 1.00$ eV, $\\phi = 2.36$ eV, and we need to find the time $t$ required to produce a photoelectron.\n\nWe can rearrange the formula to get:\n$t = \\frac{E_k + \\phi}{h\\nu}$.\n\nSince we know that $\\nu = \\frac{1}{c} \\cdot \\frac{P}{A}$, where $P$ is the power of the light, $A$ is the area of the metal surface, and $c$ is the speed
