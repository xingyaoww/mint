More simply, the speed of sound is how fast vibrations travel.\nThe speed of sound in an ideal gas depends only on its temperature and composition. The speed has a weak dependence on frequency and pressure in ordinary air, deviating slightly from ideal behavior.\nIn colloquial speech, speed of sound refers to the speed of sound waves in air.
