Let $O_k$ be the observation on day k, where $O_k = 1$ represents the person bringing an umbrella and $O_k = 0$ represents not bringing an umbrella.\n\nWe can define the following variables:\n- $P(W_k = i | O_{1:k}, W_{1:k-1}) = \\text{probability of weather on day k being i given the observed sequence of states and the true sequence of states up to day k-1}$\n- $P(O_k = j | W_k = i) = \\text{probability of observing j on day k given that the weather on day k is i}$\n\nWe can use the Viterbi algorithm to compute the most likely sequence of weather as follows:\n\n1.

We want to find the number of positive integral values of x \u2264 100 for which 3^x \u2212 x^2 is divisible by 5. \n\nFirst, let's consider the remainders of powers of 3 modulo 5. We can observe that 3^1 \u2261 3 (mod 5), 3^2 \u2261 4 (mod 5), 3^3 \u2261 2 (mod 5), 3^4 \u2261 1 (mod 5), and then the pattern repeats. This means that 3^x is congruent to either 3 or 4 modulo 5, depending on whether x is odd or even.\n\nNext, let's consider the remainder of x^2 modulo 5. Since 5 is not a perfect square, the remainders of squares of integers modulo 5 are {0, 1, 4}.\n\nNow, we want to find the values of x for which 3^x \u2212 x^2 is divisible by 5. This means that the difference between a number congruent to 3 or 4 modulo 5 and a number congruent to 0, 1, or 4 modulo 5 is divisible by 5. \n\nWe can see that if 3^x is congruent to 3 modulo 5 (i.e., x is odd), then 3^x \u2212 x^2 is congruent to 3 \u2212 x^2 modulo 5. The only way for this to be divisible by 5 is if x is congruent to 0 or 5 modulo 5. There are 20 such values of x \u2264 100.\n\nSimilarly, if 3^x is congruent to 4 modulo 5 (i.e., x is even), then 3^x \u2212 x^2 is congruent to 4 \u2212 x^2 modulo 5. The only way for this to be divisible by 5 is if x is congruent to 0 or 4 modulo 5.

Let f be a real function on [0,1].

In other words, it measures how much the function can \"jump\" or \"wiggle\" within the interval.\n\nIf the bounded variation of f on [0,1] equals f(1)-f(0), we can write this as:\n\nV(f, [0,1]) = f(1) - f(0)\n\nwhere V(f, [0,1]) denotes the bounded variation of f on [0,1].\n\nNow, let's consider the monotonicity of f. A function is increasing if its values increase as we move from left to right along the domain, and it is decreasing if its values decrease as we move from left to right along the domain.\n\nIf f is increasing on [0,1], then f(1) > f(0), and the difference f(1) - f(0) is positive. Since the bounded variation of f on [0,1] is equal to f(1) - f(0), this implies that the bounded variation is positive. However, the bounded variation of a function is always non-negative, regardless of whether the function is increasing or decreasing. Therefore, the fact that the bounded variation is positive does not necessarily mean that f is increasing.\n\nSimilarly, if f is decreasing on [0,1], then f(1) < f(0), and the difference f(1) - f(0) is negative. Again, the bounded variation of a function is always non-negative, regardless of whether the function is increasing or decreasing. Therefore, the fact that the bounded variation is negative does not necessarily mean that f is decreasing.\n\nIn conclusion, the fact that the bounded variation of f on [0,1] equals f(1)-f(0) does not provide enough information to determine whether f is increasing or decreasing on [0,1].
