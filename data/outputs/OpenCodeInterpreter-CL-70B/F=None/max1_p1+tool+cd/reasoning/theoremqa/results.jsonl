In mathematics, the variation of a function is a measure of how much a function changes or 'varies' over a given interval. For a function to have bounded variation, the total change or variation in the function must be finite.\n\nThe question states that if the bounded variation of f equals f(1)-f(0), then we need to determine whether f is increasing, decreasing, or neither.\n\nIf the variation of the function equals f(1)-f(0), this means the function changes by the amount of f(1)-f(0) over the interval [0,1]. This change could be positive or negative, depending on whether f(1) is greater than or less than f(0).\n\nIf f(1) is greater than f(0), the function would increase over the interval, and if f(1) is less than f(0), the function would decrease over the interval.
