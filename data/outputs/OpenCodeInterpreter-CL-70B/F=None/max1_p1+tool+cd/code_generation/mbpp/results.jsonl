The sequence is generated by a function that takes two initial parameters, and a step-value parameter. The sequence is generated by adding the step-value to the previous number in the sequence.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to understand that the sequence will be infinite, and there is no way to verify that a number is definitely not in the sequence because it is infinite. So the best way to do this is to check for a given number in the sequence within a certain range.\n\nThe function does_Contain_B(a, b, x) should return True if the number x is in the sequence generated by a and b, and False otherwise.\n\nWe will assume a is the first number in the sequence and b is the second number in the sequence.\n\nThe sequence generated by a, b and x could be: a, b, a+x, b+x, a+2x, b+2x, ...\n\nTherefore, we need to check if x is a multiple of a or b in the sequence.\n\nTo implement this, we will create a function that checks if a number is a multiple of a or b.\n\nWe will use the modulus operator (%) in Python, which returns the remainder of the division. If a number modulus another number equals zero, it means that the number is a multiple of that number.\n\nWe will use a while loop to keep generating the sequence until we reach a number where (number mod a == 0) or (number mod b == 0).
