His roles typified teenage disillusionment and social estrangement of his time. He had uncredited gigs from 1951 to 1953 before starring as a rebellious son attempting to win his father's approval in East of Eden (1955). In Rebel Without a Cause (1955), he portrayed a teenager frustrated with his family and social life. His last lead role was a Texan rancher who discovered oil and became rich, in Giant (1956).\nDean died in a car crash in 1955. He became the only actor to receive two posthumous Academy Award acting nominations, being nominated in the Best Actor category for East of Eden and Giant. In 1999, the American Film Institute ranked him the 18th best male movie star of Golden Age Hollywood in the AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars list.

Let's use the Haversine formula to calculate the distance between two lat-long points. The Haversine formula gives the shortest distance between two points on the surface of a sphere, which in this case is the Earth. The formula is given by:\n\nd = 2 * R * asin(sqrt(a))\nwhere R is the Earth's radius (mean radius = 6,371km);\nd = distance in km, which we can set to 3km for our case;\na = (sin(\u0394\u03c6/2))^2 + cos \u03c61 * cos \u03c62 * (sin(\u0394\u03bb/2))^2;\n\u03a6 is the latitude, and \u03bb is the longitude.\n\nWe can use the SymPy package to calculate this.\n\nLet's calculate the inner suburbs that are 3km south of Sydney's central business district.\n\nHere is the code:\n\nfrom sympy import symbols, sqrt, sin, cos, asin\n\n# define the variables\nphi1, phi2, delta_lambda = symbols('phi1 phi2 delta_lambda')\n\n# define the Earth's radius\nR = 6371  # in km\n\n# define the distance we are looking for\ndistance = 3  # in km\n\n# the Haversine formula\na = (sin(delta_lambda/2))**2 * cos(phi1) * cos(phi2) + (sin((phi2-phi1)/2))**2\n\n# calculate the latitude and longitude difference\ndelta_phi = asin(sqrt(a))\n\n# calculate the distance\nd = 2 * R * asin(sqrt(a))\n\n# find the suburbs that have a distance of 3km from the central business district\nsuburbs_3km_south = [suburb for suburb in suburbs if abs(d.evalf(subs={phi1: sub\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Observation:\nI don't understand your input. \nIf you want to execute code, please use <execute> YOUR_CODE_HERE </execute>.\nIf you want to give me an answer, please use <solution> YOUR_SOLUTION_HERE </solution>.\nFor example: The answer to the question is <solution> 42 </solution>. \n\nYou have 3 steps left and 2 chances to propose solution left.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Assistant:\nI apologize for the confusion.
