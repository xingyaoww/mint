I need to correct the formula for the sum of a geometric progression series. The correct formula is S = a * (r^n - 1) / (r - 1), where a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms. I should calculate the number of terms first. </thought>\n<execute>\ndef sum_gp(a, r, n):\n    sum_gp = a * (r**n - 1) / (r - 1)\n    return sum_gp\nres = sum_gp(1, 2, 5)\nassert res == 31, \"Expected 31 but got {}\".format(res)\n</execute>\n"}], "finished": true, "success": false, "latest_output": {"observation": null, "feedback": "", "feedback_type": "no_feedback", "success": false, "content": "Observation:\nYour answer is wrong.\nYou have 1 steps left and 1 chances to propose solution left.\nYou should take the last step to propose a solution.\n"}, "agent_action_count": {"propose_solution": 1, "use_tool": 2, "invalid_action": 0}, "token_counter": {"prompt_tokens": 3160, "total_tokens": 3580, "completion_tokens": 420}, "terminate_reason": "max_steps", "error": null}, "task": {"task_name": "mbpp", "task_id": 90, "prompt": "Write a function to find the sum of geometric progression series.\nassert sum_gp(1,5,2)==31", "reference": "assert sum_gp(1,5,2)==31\nassert sum_gp(1,5,4)==341\nassert sum_gp(2,6,3)==728", "metadata": {}}}
