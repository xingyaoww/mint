The film stars Mason Thames, Madeleine McGraw, Jeremy Davies, James Ransone, and Ethan Hawke.

In the 1960s and 1970s, he moved towards sexploitation and pornographic films such as The Sinister Urge (1960), Orgy of the Dead (1965) and Necromania (1971), and wrote over 80 lurid pulp crime and sex novels.\nNotable for their campy aesthetics, technical errors, unsophisticated special effects, use of poorly-matched stock footage, eccentric casts, idiosyncratic stories and non sequitur dialogue, Wood's films remained largely obscure until he was posthumously awarded a Golden Turkey Award for Worst Director of All Time in 1980, renewing public interest in his life and work.Fol...\n[Output Truncated]\nYou have 4 steps left and 2 chances to propose solution left.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Assistant:\n <thought> From the Wikipedia search results, we can see that Scott Derrickson is an American filmmaker, and Ed Wood was an American filmmaker as well.
