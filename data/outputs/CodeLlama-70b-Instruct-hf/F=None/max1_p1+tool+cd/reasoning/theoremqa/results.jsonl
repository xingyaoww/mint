Find the interval in which the smallest positive root of the following equations lies: x^3 - x - 4 = 0.\n 2. Determine the roots correct to two decimal places using the bisection method.\n\nAssistant:\n<thought> To find the interval in which the smallest positive root of the equation x^3 - x - 4 = 0 lies, we can use the Intermediate Value Theorem. We need to find two values of x, one less than the root and one greater than the root, such that the function evaluates to a negative value at the smaller x and a positive value at the larger x. This will allow us to determine an interval in which the root lies.\n\nTo determine the roots correct to two decimal places using the bisection method, we need to implement the bisection method algorithm. The bisection method is a root-finding algorithm that works by repeatedly bisecting an interval and selecting the subinterval in which the function changes sign. It converges quickly if the function is continuous and the starting interval contains a root.\n\nLet's start by importing the necessary libraries and defining the function.\n</thought>\n<execute>\nimport math\n\ndef f(x):\n    return x**3 - x - 4\n</execute>\n\nAssistant:\n<thought> Now, let's define the bisection method function.
