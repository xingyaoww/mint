In this case, the cross section is 17 barns, and the thickness of the silver layer is 2 mm.\n\nTo calculate the probability of a neutron being captured, we need to convert the cross section from barns to square meters.

We need to find the number of positive integral values of x \u2264 100 for which 3^x \u2212 x^2 is divisible by 5.\n\nTo check if a number is divisible by 5, we can check if the last digit is 0 or 5.
