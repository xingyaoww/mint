It is also not a tabloid-style magazine, as it does not focus on sensationalism or gossip.\n\nStep 3: Tabloid-style magazines\nTabloid-style magazines are characterized by their focus on sensationalism and gossip. They typically have a large format, with a mix of text and images, and are often sold at a lower price than other magazines.\n\nStep 4: Conclusion\nGiven the above information, it is clear that neither Skeptical Inquirer nor The Progressive Populist is a tabloid-style magazine.
