Inversion means the order of the elements. For example, in the tuple (1, 2), (2, 1) is the inversion of the original tuple. I will use the function 'factorial' to calculate the number of inversions. The factorial of a number 'n' is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to 'n'. 1 factorial is 1, 2 factorial is 2, 3 factorial is 6 and so on.\n\nI will first calculate the factorial of the length of the tuple.
