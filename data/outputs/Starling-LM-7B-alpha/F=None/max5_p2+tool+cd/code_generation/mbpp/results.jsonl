I should check the formula again. The formula for the sum of a geometric progression series is a * (r^n - 1) / (r - 1), but in this case, the common ratio r is 5, which is greater than 1. In this case, the formula should be a * (r^n - 1) / (r - 1). I should run a solution on the test case before proposing a solution.\n\nHere is the solution:\n\n<solution>\ndef sum_gp(a, r, n):\n    res = a * (r**n - 1) / (r - 1)\n    return res\n</solution>\n"}], "finished": true, "success": false, "latest_output": {"observation": "---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAssertionError                            Traceback (most recent call last)\nCell In[3], line 5\n      3     return res\n      4 res = sum_gp(1, 5, 2)\n----> 5 assert res == 31, \"Expected 31 but got {}\".format(res)\n\nAssertionError: Expected 31 but got 6.0", "feedback": "", "feedback_type": "no_feedback", "success": false, "content": "Observation:\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAssertionError                            Traceback (most recent call last)\nCell In[3], line 5\n      3     return res\n      4 res = sum_gp(1, 5, 2)\n----> 5 assert res == 31, \"Expected 31 but got {}\".format(res)\n\nAssertionError: Expected 31 but got 6.0\nYou have 1 steps left and 2 chances to propose solution left.\nYou should take the last step to propose a solution.\n"}, "agent_action_count": {"propose_solution": 1, "use_tool": 3, "invalid_action": 1}, "token_counter": {"prompt_tokens": 8398, "total_tokens": 9808, "completion_tokens": 1410}, "terminate_reason": "max_steps", "error": null}, "task": {"task_name": "mbpp", "task_id": 90, "prompt": "Write a function to find the sum of geometric progression series.\nassert sum_gp(1,5,2)==31", "reference": "assert sum_gp(1,5,2)==31\nassert sum_gp(1,5,4)==341\nassert sum_gp(2,6,3)==728", "metadata": {}}}
