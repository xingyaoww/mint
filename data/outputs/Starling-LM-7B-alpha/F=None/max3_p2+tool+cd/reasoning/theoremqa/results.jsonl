Since $2^n$ is always even, $n$ must be a multiple of 2.\n2. $n-1$ divides $2^n-1$: This condition implies that $n-1$ is a factor of $2^n-1$.

With these tools, we can only construct lines, circles, and their intersections. We can't use tools like rulers or compasses to measure lengths directly.\n\nFor a cube, the volume is given by the formula $V = s^3$, where $s$ is the length of an edge. The volume of a given cube is $V_0 = s_0^3$, where $s_0$ is the length of an edge of the given cube.\n\nWe want to construct a cube with volume $X$ times the volume of the given cube, so we need to find a length $s$ such that $s^3 = X \\cdot s_0^3$. Taking the cube root of both sides, we get $s = \\sqrt[3]{X \\cdot s_0^3}$.\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can construct this length $s$ using compass and straightedge. Since we can only construct lines and circles, we need to check if the cube root of $X \\cdot s_0^3$ can be expressed as a length that can be constructed using compass and straightedge.\n\nFor each value of $X$ in the set {3, 17, 8, 27, 343, 1331}, we will check if the cube root of $X \\cdot s_0^3$ can be constructed using compass and straightedge. If it can, we will include the value of $X$ in the answer list with a 1; otherwise, we will include it with a 0.\n\nHere are the values of $X$ and their corresponding cube roots:\n\n- For $X = 3$, the cube root of $3 \\cdot s_0^3$ is $\\sqrt[3]{3 \\cdot s_0^3}$. Since 3 is a perfect cube, we can construct a length that is the cube root of a number using compass and straightedge.

Since 8 is not a perfect cube, we cannot construct a length that is the cube root of a number using compass and straightedge. Therefore, we cannot construct a cube with volume 8 times the volume of the given cube.\n- For $X = 27$, the cube root of $27 \\cdot s_0^3$ is $\\sqrt[3]{27 \\cdot s_0^3}$.

Therefore, we can construct a cube with volume 343 times the volume of the given cube.\n- For $X = 1331$, the cube root of $1331 \\cdot s_0^3$ is $\\sqrt[3]{1331 \\cdot s_0^3}$. Since 1331 is not a perfect cube, we cannot construct a length that is the cube root of a number using compass and straightedge.

The score function is the derivative of the log-likelihood function with respect to the parameter $\\theta$. For the Gaussian distribution, the log-likelihood function is $\\log f_\\theta(x) = -\\frac{1}{2}\\log(2\\pi\\theta) - \\frac{1}{2\\theta}x^2$. The derivative of the log-likelihood function with respect to $\\theta$ is $\\frac{1}{2\\theta^2}x^2 - \\frac{1}{2\\theta}$. Taking the expected value of the square of the score function, we get $\\frac{1}{2\\theta^2}\\mathbb{E}[x^4] - \\frac{2}{\\theta^3}\\mathbb{E}[x^2] + \\frac{1}{\\theta^4}$. For the Gaussian distribution, $\\mathbb{E}[x^4] = 3\\theta^4$ and $\\mathbb{E}[x^2] = \\theta^2$. Substituting these values, we get $\\frac{3}{2\\theta^2} - \\frac{2}{\\theta^3}\\theta^2 + \\frac{1}{\\theta^4} = \\frac{3}{2\\theta^2} - \\frac{2}{\\theta} + \\frac{1}{\\theta^4}$.
