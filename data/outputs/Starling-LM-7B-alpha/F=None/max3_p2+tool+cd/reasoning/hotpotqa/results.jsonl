In 1791, the English inventor John Barber patented a gas turbine. In 1794, Thomas Mead patented a gas engine. Also in 1794, Robert Street patented an internal-combustion engine, which was also the first to use liquid fuel (petroleum) and built an engine around that time. In 1798, John Stevens designed the first American internal combustion engine. In 1807, French engineers Nic\u00e9phore and Claude Ni\u00e9pce ran  a prototype internal combustion engine, using controlled dust explosions, the Pyr\u00e9olophore.
