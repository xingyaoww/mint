We can start by analyzing the divisibility conditions.\n\n1. $n$ divides $2^n$: This condition implies that $n$ is a factor of $2^n$. Since $2^n$ is always even, $n$ must be a multiple of 2.\n2. $n-1$ divides $2^n-1$: This condition implies that $n-1$ is a factor of $2^n-1$. We can rewrite this condition as $2^n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{n-1}$. This condition is known as Fermat's Little Theorem.\n3. $n-2$ divides $2^n - 2$: This condition implies that $n-2$ is a factor of $2^n - 2$.

With these tools, we can only construct lines, circles, and their intersections. We can't use tools like rulers or compasses to measure lengths directly.\n\nFor a cube, the volume is given by the formula $V = s^3$, where $s$ is the length of an edge. The volume of a given cube is $V_0 = s_0^3$, where $s_0$ is the length of an edge of the given cube.\n\nWe want to construct a cube with volume $X$ times the volume of the given cube, so we need to find a length $s$ such that $s^3 = X \\cdot s_0^3$. Taking the cube root of both sides, we get $s = \\sqrt[3]{X \\cdot s_0^3}$.\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can construct this length $s$ using compass and straightedge.
