Assuming the weather on day $k$ is dependent on the weather on day $k-1$. We can write the transition probability as P(sunny $\\mid$ sunny) = P(rain $\\mid$ rain) = 0.7. The person has 60\\% chance to bring an umbrella when the weather is rainy, and 40\\% chance to bring an umbrella when the weather is sunny, i.e. P(umbrella $\\mid$ rain) = 0.6 and P(umbrella $\\mid$ sunny) = 0.4. If we observe that the person (1) brought an umbrella on day 1, (2) did not bring an umbrella on day 2, (3) brought an umbrella on day 3.  What are the most likely weather from day 1 to day 3?
