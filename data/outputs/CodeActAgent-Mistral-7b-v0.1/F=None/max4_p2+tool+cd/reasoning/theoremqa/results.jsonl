Consequently, parameters such as mean and variance also do not change over time. If you draw a line through the middle of a stationary process then it should be flat; it may have 'seasonal' cycles around the trend line, but overall it does not trend up nor down.\nSince stationarity is an assumption underlying many statistical procedures used in time series analysis, non-stationary data are often transformed to become stationary. The most common cause of violation of stationarity is a trend in the mean, which can be due either to the presence of a unit root or of a deterministic trend. In the former case of a unit root, stochastic shocks have permanent effects, and the process is not mean-reverting. In the latter\nYou have 3 steps left and 2 chances to propose solution left.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Assistant:\n<thought>\nFrom the wiki_search result, we can see that a stationary

grows linearly with n, we need to understand what is meant by \"dependence\" and \"n-blocks\".\nLet's assume that the dependence between adjacent n-blocks of a stationary process is measured by the correlation coefficient.\nThe correlation coefficient between two n-blocks, r_n, can be calculated as:\nr_n = cov(X_n, X_{n+1}) / (std(X_n) * std(X_{n+1}))\nwhere X_n and X_{n+1} are the n-block and (n+1)-block, respectively, and cov(X_n, X_{n+1}) is the covariance between them.\nstd(X_n) and std(X_{n+1}) are the standard deviations of the n-block and (n+1)-block, respectively.\nIf the
