His books have sold more than 300 million copies worldwide. Dahl has been called \"one of the greatest storytellers for children of the 20th century\".Dahl was born in Wales to affluent Norwegian immigrant parents, and spent most of his life in England. He served in the Royal Air Force (RAF) during the Second World War. He became a fighter pilot and, subsequently, an intelligence officer, rising to the rank of acting wing commander.
