Consequently, parameters such as mean and variance also do not change over time. If you draw a line through the middle of a stationary process then it should be flat; it may have 'seasonal' cycles around the trend line, but overall it does not trend up nor down.\nSince stationarity is an assumption underlying many statistical procedures used in time series analysis, non-stationary data are often transformed to become stationary.

A function is said to have bounded variation on an interval if the variation of the function over any subinterval of the interval is bounded. The variation of a function over an interval is defined as the supremum of the absolute values of the function over the interval.\n\nIf a function f is increasing on [0,1], then its variation over any subinterval [a,b] of [0,1] is bounded by the difference between the maximum and minimum values of f over [a,b], which is bounded by the maximum of f(b) and f(a) minus the minimum of f(b) and f(a). This means that the variation of f over [0,1] is bounded by f(1) - f(0).\n\nSimilarly, if a function f is decreasing on [0,1], then its variation over any subinterval [a,b] of [0,1] is bounded by the difference between the maximum and minimum values of f over [a,b], which is bounded by the maximum of f(a) and f(b) minus the minimum of f(a) and f(b). This means that the variation of f over [0,1] is bounded by f(0) - f(1).\n\nIf a function f is neither increasing nor decreasing on [0,1], then its variation over any subinterval [a,b] of [0,1] can be arbitrarily large, as it can have arbitrarily large oscillations. This means that the variation of f over [0,1] can be arbitrarily large, and it is not necessarily equal to f(1) - f(0).\n\nTherefore, if the bounded variation of f on [0,1] equals f(1)-f(0), then the function f must be either increasing or decreasing on [0,1]. However, the given function f = x(x-1)(x-2) is neither increasing nor decreasing on [0,1], as it has a maximum at x = 1 and a minimum at x = 0 and x = 2.
