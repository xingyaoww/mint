The projection of a vector v onto a subspace W is given by the formula v = w + (v-w)\u22a5, where w is the projection of v onto W and (v-w)\u22a5 is the component of v orthogonal to W. The matrix P that projects a vector v onto the space spanned by the columns of \u03a6 can be obtained by multiplying \u03a6 with the Moore-Penrose inverse of \u03a6^T\u03a6, which is the pseudoinverse of \u03a6.
