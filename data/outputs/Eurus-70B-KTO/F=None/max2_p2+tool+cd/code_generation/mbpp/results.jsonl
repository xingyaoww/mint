For each number in the range, it converts it to a hexadecimal string representation using the `hex()` function and removes the '0x' prefix using slicing.\n\nThe function then checks if all characters in the hexadecimal string representation are valid hexadecimal digits (0-9, a-f, A-F) using the `all()` function and a generator expression. If all characters are valid hexadecimal digits, the function increments the `count` variable.\n\nFinally, the function returns the `count` of hexadecimal numbers within the range.\n\nThe provided assert statement tests the function with the given range (10, 15) and checks if the count of hexadecimal numbers is equal to 6.
