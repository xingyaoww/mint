In this case, since there are 50 sellers, there must be 50 buyers willing to pay that price. Since there are initially 50 buyers willing to pay $10,000, we can find the number of buyers willing to pay $6,000 by subtracting half the difference between the number of buyers at $10,000 and 50 from the total number of buyers at $10,000.
