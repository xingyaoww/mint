Since $n$ divides $2^n$, we have $2^n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{n}$. This means that $n$ is a factor of $2^n$.\n\nNext, we have $n-1$ divides $2^n-1$. This can be written as $2^n-1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{n-1}$. Using the binomial theorem, we can expand this expression as follows:\n\n$2^n-1 = 2^n - 2^0 = 2^n(2^0 - 1) + 2^n(1 - 2^0) = 2^n - 2^n(1 - 2^0) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{n-1}$.\n\nSince $n-1$ is a factor of $2^n-1$, we have $2^n(1 - 2^0) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{n-1}$. This implies that either $2^n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{n-1}$ or $1 - 2^0 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{n-1}$.\n\nSince $n-1$ is less than $n$, we cannot have $2^n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{n-1}$. Therefore, we must have $1 - 2^0 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{n-1}$. This means that $2^0 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{n-1}$.\n\nNow, let's find the conditions for $n-2$. Since $n-2$ divides $2^n-2$, we have $2^n-2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{n-2}$. Using the binomial theorem again, we can expand this expression as follows:\n\n$2^n-2 = 2^n - 2^2 = 2^n(2^2 - 1) + 2^n(1 - 2^2) = 2^n -\n"}], "finished": true, "success": false, "latest_output": {"content": "You are a helpful assistant assigned with the task of problem-solving.

The supply of good cars is 50, and the demand is the number of buyers who are willing to pay $10,000 for a good car. At this price, the demand is 50, as all 50 good cars are sold. The supply is also 50, as all sellers sell their good cars at this price.

Bounded variation of a function f on an interval [a,b] is defined as the supremum of the sum of the absolute values of the differences of f at any finite number of points in [a,b].\n\nLet's assume that the bounded variation of f on [0,1] is equal to f(1)-f(0).\n\nIf f is increasing on [0,1], then the differences of f at any finite number of points in [0,1] are non-negative. This implies that the sum of the absolute values of these differences is equal to the sum of the differences themselves, which is the same as f(1)-f(0). Therefore, the bounded variation of f on [0,1] is equal to f(1)-f(0).\n\nIf f is decreasing on [0,1], then the differences of f at any finite number of points in [0,1] are non-positive.
