Create an empty queue and enqueue the starting node (node 0) into the queue.\n2. Create an empty set to keep track of visited nodes.\n3. Create an empty dictionary to store the parent of each node.\n4. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a node from the queue.\n   - If the dequeued node is the destination node (node 5), then we have found the shortest path.\n   - Otherwise, for each neighbor of the dequeued node that has not been visited, enqueue the neighbor into the queue, mark it as visited, and set its parent in the dictionary.\n5. If the destination node (node 5) is not found, then there is no path from node 0 to node 5.\n6. If the destination node (node 5) is found, then we can backtrack from the destination node to find the shortest path.

The volume of a cube is given by the formula V = a^3, where a is the edge length.\n\nTo find the edge length of the constructed cube, we can use the method of compass and straightedge construction. This involves using a ruler and a protractor to measure the angles and distances between the vertices of the given cube and the constructed cube.\n\nLet's calculate the edge length of the constructed cube for each value of X in the given set {3, 17, 8, 27, 343, 1331} using the method of compass and straightedge construction.\n\nFor X = 3, we can construct a cube with an edge length of 3 units. The volume of the constructed cube is equal to 3^3 = 27 cubic units, which is equal to 3 times the volume of the given cube. Therefore, the answer is [1].\n\nFor X = 17, we can construct a cube with an edge length of 17 units. The volume of the constructed cube is equal to 17^3 = 4913 cubic units, which is equal to 17 times the volume of the given cube. Therefore, the answer is [1].\n\nFor X = 8, we can construct a cube with an edge length of 8 units. The volume of the constructed cube is equal to 8^3 = 512 cubic units, which is equal to 8 times the volume of the given cube. Therefore, the answer is [1].\n\nFor X = 27, we can construct a cube with an edge length of 27 units. The volume of the constructed cube is equal to 27^3 = 12167 cubic units, which is equal to 27 times the volume of the given cube. Therefore, the answer is [1].\n\nFor X = 343, we can construct a cube with an edge length of 343 units.
