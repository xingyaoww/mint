Create an empty queue and enqueue the starting node (node 0) into the queue.\n2. Create an empty set to keep track of visited nodes.\n3.

While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a node from the queue.\n   - If the dequeued node is the destination node (node 5), then we have found the shortest path.\n   - Otherwise, for each neighbor of the dequeued node that has not been visited, enqueue the neighbor into the queue, mark it as visited, and set its parent in the dictionary.\n5. If the destination node (node 5) is found, create an empty list to store the shortest path.\n6. Start from the destination node (node 5) and follow the parent pointers in the dictionary to reach the starting node (node 0). Add each node to the list representing the shortest path.\n7.
