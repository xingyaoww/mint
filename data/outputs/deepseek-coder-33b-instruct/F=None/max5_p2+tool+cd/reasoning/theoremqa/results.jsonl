However, this would be computationally expensive and time-consuming.\n\nA more efficient approach is to use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT). The CRT states that if the integers a1, a2, ..., ak are pairwise coprime (their greatest common divisor is 1) and if a solution exists, then it can be found.\n\nIn this case, we have three equations:\nn = 2^n (mod n)\nn-1 = 2^n-1 (mod n-1)\nn-2 = 2^n-2 (mod n-2)\n\nWe can solve these equations using the CRT to find the solutions.\n\nHowever, the CRT does not directly apply to the third equation, as n-2 is not coprime with n-2. We can solve this equation by noting that 2^n-2 is always even, and n-2 is always odd, so n-2 can only divide 2^n-2 if n-2 is 2.\n\nTherefore, the only possible solution is n=2.\n</thought>\n\n<solution> [2] </solution>\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Observation:\nYour answer is wrong.\nYou have 4 steps left and 1 chances to propose solution left.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Assistant:\nI apologize for the mistake.
