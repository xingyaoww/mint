However, this would be computationally expensive and time-consuming.\n\nA more efficient approach is to use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT). The CRT states that if the integers a1, a2, ..., ak are pairwise coprime (their greatest common divisor is 1), then for any given integers n1, n2, ..., nk, there exists one and only one integer x such that x \u2261 n1 (mod a1), x \u2261 n2 (mod a2), ..., x \u2261 nk (mod ak).\n\nIn this problem, we have a1 = n, a2 = n-1, a3 = n-2, and n1 = n2 = n3 = 2^n. Therefore, we can use the CRT to find the solution.\n\nHowever, the CRT is not directly applicable here because the moduli a1, a2, a3 are not pairwise coprime. However, we can still use the CRT if we find a way to reduce the problem to a form where the moduli are pairwise coprime.\n\nWe can do this by noting that n divides 2^n, n-1 divides 2^n-1, and n-2 divides 2^n-2 if and only if n divides 2^n - 2^n-1 + 2^n-2. This is because the difference of two numbers that are multiples of n is also a multiple of n.\n\nSo, we can rewrite the problem as finding all positive integers n less than 2^250 for which n divides 2^n - 2^n-1 + 2^n-2.\n\nWe can then use the CRT to find the solution.\n</thought>\n\n<execute>\nfrom sympy import *\n\ndef solve():\n    result = []\n    for\n"}], "finished": true, "success": false, "latest_output": {"content": "You are a helpful assistant assigned with the task of problem-solving.
