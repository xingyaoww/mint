The Sherlock Holmes stories are milestones in the field of crime fiction.\nDoyle was a prolific writer; other than Holmes stories, his works include fantasy and science fiction stories about Professor Challenger, and humorous stories about the Napoleonic soldier Brigadier Gerard, as well as plays, romances, poetry, non-fiction, and historical novels. One of Doyle's early short stories, \"J. Habakuk Jephson's Statement\" (1884), helped to popularise the mystery of the Mary Celeste.\n\nPage: The Lost World (Doyle novel)\nSummary: The Lost World is a science fiction novel by British writer Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, published by Hodder & Stoughton in 1912, concerning an expedition to a plateau in the Amazon basin of\nYou have 3 steps left and 2 chances to propose solution left.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Assistant:\n<thought>\nFrom the wiki_search result, we can see that Arthur Conan Doyle was born on 22 May 1859.\nNow, let's search for Penelope Lively's birth year.\n</thought>\n<execute> print(wikipedia_search('Penelope Lively')) </execute>\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Observation:\nPage: Penelope Lively\nSummary: Dame Penelope Margaret Lively   (n\u00e9e  Low; born 17 March 1933) is a British writer of fiction for both children and adults.
