What is the number of labelled forests on 8 vertices with 5 connected components, such that vertices 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 all belong to different connected components? Output format required: integer\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Assistant:\n The number of labelled forests on 8 vertices with 5 connected components, such that vertices 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 all belong to different connected components, can be calculated using a combinatorial approach. This problem can be solved by considering the number of ways to choose the vertices for each connected component and then accounting for the different ways to connect the components.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use the concept of labelled forests and connected components. A labelled forest is a graph in which each connected component is a tree, and each vertex is assigned a unique label. In this case, we have 8 vertices, and we want to find the number of labelled forests with 5 connected components, where vertices 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 belong to different connected components.\n\nWe can break down the problem into several steps:\n\n1. Choose the vertices for the first connected component. Since we want vertices 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 to belong to different connected components, we can choose any 4 vertices from these 5 vertices. This can be calculated using the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of vertices and k is the number of vertices to choose. In this case, we have C(5, 4) = 5! / (4!(5-4)!) = 5.\n\n2. Choose the vertices for the second connected component. Since we want this component to be distinct from the first one, we can choose any 3 vertices from the remaining 3 vertices (6, 7, 8). This can be calculated using the combination formula: C(3, 3) = 3! / (3!(3-3)!) = 1.\n\n3. Connect the components. We can connect the components in different ways, but since the components are distinct, the order of connection does not matter. Therefore, we can use the formula for permutations of distinct objects: P(n, k) = n! / (n-k)!, where n is the total number of objects and k is the number of objects to arrange. In this case, we have P(2, 2) = 2! / (2-2)! = 1.\n\n4.
