To solve the task, I need to find a lettuce, then clean it with sinkbasin, then put it in diningtable.
First I need to find a lettuce. A lettuce is more likely to appear in fridge (1), diningtable (1), sinkbasin (1), stoveburner (1-3), cabinet (1-13). I can check one by one.

```python
for loc_to_check in ["fridge 1", "diningtable 1", "sinkbasin 1", "stoveburner 1", "stoveburner 2", "stoveburner 3", *[f"cabinet {i}" for i in range(1, 14)]]:
    res = goto(loc_to_check)
    if "closed" in res:
        # The receptacle is closed. I need to open it to see what's inside.
        res = open_receptacle(loc_to_check)

    if "lettuce" in res:
        print(res)
        print(f"Found a lettuce in {loc_to_check}.")
        break
```
