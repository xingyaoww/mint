To solve the task, I need to find and take a sparybottle, then put it on toilet.
First I need to find a spraybottle. A spraybottle is more likely to appear in cabinet (1-4), sinkbasin (1-2), and garbagecan (1). I can check one by one.

```python
for loc_to_check in ["cabinet 1", "cabinet 2", "cabinet 3", "cabinet 4", "sinkbasin 1", "sinkbasin 2", "garbagecan 1"]:
    res = goto(loc_to_check)
    print(res)
    if "closed" in res:
        # The receptacle is closed. I need to open it to see what's inside.
        res = open_receptacle(loc_to_check)
        print(res)
    if "spraybottle" in res:
        print(f"Found a spraybottle in {loc_to_check}.")
        break
```
