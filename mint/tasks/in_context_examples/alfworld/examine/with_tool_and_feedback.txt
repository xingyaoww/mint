You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you see a coffeetable 1, a diningtable 1, a drawer 4, a drawer 3, a drawer 2, a drawer 1, a dresser 1, a garbagecan 1, a sidetable 2, a sidetable 1, and a sofa 1.

To solve the task, I need to find and take a statue, then find and use a desklamp.
First I need to find a statue. A statue is more likely to appear in dresser (1), coffeetable (1), sidetable (1-2), diningtable (1), sofa (1), garbagecan (1). I can check one by one.
</thought>
```python
for loc_to_check in ["dresser 1", "coffeetable 1", "sidetable 1", "sidetable 2", "diningtable 1", "sofa 1", "garbagecan 1"]:
    res = goto(loc_to_check)
    print(res)
    if "closed" in res:
        # The receptacle is closed. I need to open it to see what's inside.
        res = open_receptacle(loc_to_check)
        print(res)

    if "statue" in res:
        print(f"Found a statue in {loc_to_check}.")
        break
```

Observation:
On the dresser 1, you see a cellphone 3, a newspaper 2, a statue 1, and a television 1.
Found a statue in dresser 1.

Expert feedback:
This is GOOD. You have made a good attempt to solve the task. Since you have found a statue, you can take it and find a desklamp.

Assistant:

Now I find a statue 1. Next, I need to take it and find a desklamp.
A desklamp is more likely to appear in sidetable (1-2), coffeetable (1), diningtable (1). I can check one by one, starting with sidetable 1.
</thought>
```python
print(take_from("statue 1", "dresser 1"))
for loc_to_check in ["sidetable 1", "sidetable 2", "coffeetable 1", "diningtable 1"]:
    res = goto(loc_to_check)
    print(res)
    if "closed" in res:
        # The receptacle is closed. I need to open it to see what's inside.
        res = open_receptacle(loc_to_check)
        print(res)

    if "desklamp" in res:
        print(f"Found a desklamp in {loc_to_check}.")
        break
```

Observation:
You pick up the statue 1 from the dresser 1.
On the sidetable 1, you see nothing.
On the sidetable 2, you see a desklamp 3, a newspaper 1, and a statue 2.
Found a desklamp in sidetable 2.

Expert feedback:
